            <p>Marxist Criticism of Joseph Finder’s “Paranoia”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Society has many different outlooks on life, and that changes whether you have class or not, politically powerful and even race differences. The world revolves around having specific prowess in these fields and if you don’t possess any, you’d be considered weak and worthless. These are called power struggles, and it’s becoming more and more common nowadays especially in the social scene. Throughout history, there are plenty of examples of socialist standards that are deemed immoral nowadays, but we cannot afford to eliminate them all, as there are far too many to dissect. Marxist Critics often look at how these struggles are portrayed in media, and if they’re accurate to the consequences of the modern age. Joseph Finder portrays these socialist ideals in his bestseller “Paranoia”, which we will now dissect to truly find out what are the true motives behind all these powers.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The book starts off with Adam Cassidy, exploiting the security flaws of the company he works at, Wyatt Telecommunications and embezzling thousands of dollars to throw a party for his friends. Cassidy got caught by the CEO, Nick Wyatt and was given a choice: either suffer and rot in jail for decades or become the company’s spy and discover the secrets of a rival company, Trion Systems. Now he faces a dilemma of whether to continue this life, or defect, and with no idea who to trust, Cassidy’s life turns into a nightmare of chase. This alone depicts the power, and class struggles that they faced in the novel, and we will elaborate on such in the next section.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Already in the first part of the novel, we can see the power dynamics of different employees. Take the CEO blackmailing Cassidy for example, this part shows how powerful he is and how he exploits the lower-classed protagonist, which unfortunately is a common occurrence in the work-industry like black companies. Things like being threatened are also a part of power struggles that are represented in the novel. Like when Wyatt threatened Cassidy with legal consequences unless he obeyed him, showing dominance and casting fear into the protagonist’s life.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Another Marxist issue presented in the novel is the exploitation of underprivileged individuals for a monetary reward. As many individuals are living paycheck to paycheck, these kinds of dangerous (and often, illegal) opportunities arise and get accepted, just to earn a little extra dough or provide for their families. At first Cassidy didn’t want to be a part of the espionage industry because it could cause harm to him, but after realizing that the salary expectations of being a spy is far larger than he imagined, he accepted without much hesitation. This further gets presented as Cassidy gets a more luxurious lifestyle, like better clothes, cars and more. This part shows of the two ideals: one is the desperation of man to provide, even if the consequences far outweigh the rewards given. And two, the greed of man, being that more cash value means a higher economical and social status which is crucial to survive in this type of environment.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Additionally, another issue arises: it is the ethical considerations of man, or lack thereof. Companies like Wyatt Telecommunications (the company in the series) use people like Cassidy as expendable goods. They think of employees more as tools and less as people when corporate greed expands. Trust and loyalty is also thrown into question as the greedier Cassidy becomes in the novel, emphasizing that trustworthiness is outweighed by materialistic desires and manipulating others becomes more and more common towards the end. Blackmailing is a common theme in the story as people find more ways to obtain greater power and belittle those under them.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Overall, if we look at the story from a Marxist viewpoint, many issues are addressed by the quality storytelling. Lives are changed due to power dynamics; values are exploited for economical gain; and even trust is burned as they lust for more. There is a clear understanding of the plot and the materialistic perceptions that are engraved in society and are presented with a fascinating and entertaining point of view.</p>
