            <p>Marxist Reading of Victor Hugo’s "Les Misérables" </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Throughout the history of mankind, there’s always a social class that divides the whole population. Mostly, those social classes were determined through their socio-economic status, which serves as the main driving force for the distribution and dynamics of economic power. Also, it is different ideologies that divide the people. Both socio-economic factors and the ideologies are important factors for Marxism. Marxist critics try to view different aspects of life by understanding the different ideologies and the socio-economic status of things, and they apply it even in literature. Now, we will try to analyze the novel “Les Misérables” through the lenses of Marxism. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The characters are in the poor lower class; Jean Valjean, who has been a prisoner for fourteen years, showcases the large margin between the lower class and the upper class. Jean Valjean was convicted merely because he stole a loaf of bread. This shows how flawed the justice system is in the story and how the upper class abused their authority. Additionally, Les Misérables also addresses social issues like gender, for example, that are portrayed by Fantine. Fantine, who has been a single mother for her daughter, decided to work in order to meet the needs of her child; however, since she is a woman, in that particular era, they have always been exploited by men. She had experiences of sexual exploitation by her employer, specifically the monsieur. Fantine, as her role as a mother, will do anything for his daughter, even prostitution.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Les Misérables accurately displays economic exploitation in the plot; here the workers can be easily oppressed by the upper class. Their economic status is the determining factor in how society will treat them. Since Jean Valjean and Fantine are not economically stable enough, they experienced unfair treatment by those who are in authority.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">These inequalities in the flawed justice system urge people to make a revolution, which is reflected as the French Revolution in history. Similarly, the revolution initiated by the people in the lower class aims to reform the government policies and laws and to take down those who abused their authority.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Furthermore, Javert, who is an inspector who continuously stalked and hunted Jean Valjean simply because Valjean is an ex-convict who escaped prison, plays a crucial role in the story. Javert is not in lower class but plays a significant role in upper class. His status is not particularly low and, at the same time, is not high. They are the ones who just abide by the law and follow the system by what is ordered to them by society. They are similar to police or soldiers by the ruler, which is the reason why these rulers gain too much power with confidence. They are blinded by apparently good reality. They are often blinded by the illusion, which they think is right. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Overall, the roles and destiny of the characters in the story are determined by the external factors, specifically the society. The lower class is most likely to be oppressed, as are women. Police and soldiers, who are just one status behind the ruler, play a significant role in determining how powerful a ruler can be.</p>
