            <p>Marxist Criticism of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The book makes it clear how the socioeconomic class and societal norms of the characters determine them. Gatsby's desire to transcend his lowly origins and attain a better social status is what motivates him to relentlessly pursue Daisy. <br><i>"You can't repeat the past," I suggested, "but I wouldn't ask too much of her." "Can't repeat the past?" he said incredulously. "You can, of course!" He scanned his surroundings frantically, as though the past were hiding in the shadows of his home, just out of his grasp. "I will restore everything to its previous state," he declared, nodding resolutely. "She'll see." "They had been in France for a year, Switzerland for a while, and then France for another year."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Class distinctions and the effects of wealth inequality are discussed in the book. The "Valley of Ashes," an non urbanized area populated by the working class, highlights the social and economic unfairness of the day by providing a high contrast to the luxurious lifestyle of the wealthy.<br><i>"The best thing a girl can be in this world is a gorgeous little fool, so I hope she'll be one."<br>"I didn't hear it. I had a vision of it."" I quickly remarked.<br>"Not Gatsby. A lot of these newly wealthy people are just big bootleggers, you know?"<br>" Tom urged, "I want to know who he is and what he does." "And I'm going to make it a point to find out."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The book examines the ways in which people can be used and manipulated by financial power. An excellent illustration of this is Tom Buchanan's cooperation with Myrtle Wilson, a member of a lower socioeconomic class.<br><i>"The airedale—there was definitely an airedale in it someplace, even though its feet were shockingly white—changed hands and sank onto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she rapturously caressed the weatherproof coat.<br>"Is it a girl or a boy?" she inquired tactfully. "That dog? That dog is a boy." "It's a bitch," Tom declared firmly. "This is your money. Use it to purchase ten more dogs."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The book shows how the characters' opportunities and decisions are influenced by their economic situation. Gatsby's unrelenting quest for fortune stems from his conviction that it will bring him and Daisy back together and buy happiness.<br><i>"I’m going to x everything just the way it was before."" he said, nodding determinedly. "She’ll see."</i></p>
