            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Harry was a boy, who was left at his aunt's side who's treating him badly. Not until his eleventh birthday came, Harry met Hagrid, and he told him that he was a wizard. From this day he entered Hogwarts, the school of wizards, and this became a pathway to open his new journey in the wizarding world. In this book, character archetypes will be used as critiques to analyze each character's behavior, role, personality, and purpose in the story.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Harry Potter served as a hero in the story. He has these positive traits that will surely be admired and loved by the people around him. He's down to earth, despite being a popular student in his school. All because Voldemort failed to cast a curse on him; that's also the reason why he got a scar on his forehead that symbolizes that he is "the boy who lives." Harry is the boy who survived being murdered by Lord Voldemort. In addition, when Neville Longbottom lost his memory, it's a small ball. It releases a red smoke whenever Neville forgets something. And Draco Malfoy got it; he said that he would hang it up on the tree. Harry did not like what's happening, so he stepped up and said that Draco should give it back to Neville. However, Draco is an arrogant one. He said to Harry that he must chase him and get the memory from him. At the end, Harry comes back happily holding Neville's memory. Creative and curious, he is often curious about the wizarding world.Lastly, Harry fight with Voldemort in getting the Philosopher's of stone that gives immortality. Harry beats him, and Voldemort slowly vanishes in front of them. This shows the determination, power, and confidence he put into this mission, as well as how much he cares for the sake of others.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Ron Weasley is the ride-or-die of Harry Potter; he was with him all through his journey. They go through every challenge together, and Ron never misses their battles. For instance, he helped Harry and Hermione Granger by showing his skill in the field of chess. With his skill, he became the key to their success in the game. Although from an ordinary family, Ron shows courage in the face of danger. He's the "brother of Harry's heart."</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Hermione Granger, the "scholar" of the story, is a bright student. She loves to read books and often has an answer to any question. Hermione also showed her observation skills when she showed Harry and Ron clues about the Philosopher's Stone. When they went through trials, she provided the solution and planned how they could be successful. One of her main solutions was to get Ron to play chess, which was the key to their success.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Hagrid, the "rebel" in the story, does not follow the rules of Hogwarts. He was the one who informed Harry of his being a wizard and gave important information about the Philosopher's Stone. He also took care of a dragon he named Norbert, even though it was against the rules of the wizarding world. His rebellious nature shows his strong principles and concern for his friends and other creatures.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Draco Malfoy, Harry's "rival," is an important character in the story. In their tournament, especially in the game of Quidditch, intense tension can be seen between them. In one match, Harry obtained the Golden Snitch, which gave their team 150 points, causing them to win. Her rivalry with Draco shows two different sides to the story.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Lord Voldemort, the "shadow" of the story, is the main villain. He wishes to acquire the Philosopher's Stone to restore his body and become immortal. His power was nullified when the love and protection that Lily Potter gave to her son Harry prevailed. He wants to rule the world of wizards and take back his power.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">To conclude, these characters play an important role in bringing the story to life. They showed their qualities and contributions that made Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone anticipated, thrilling, and engaging. You can see the challenges and trials they faced, which gave more depth to the story. Thus, the readers will keep coming back for more.</p>
