            <p>Feminist Criticism of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">To be a woman is to be an actress. Being a woman means that you will always be subjected to criticism and have people expecting you to follow their traditional views about how a woman should be. People are not ready to witness a woman succeeding in her life without the help of a man; they believe that a woman is weak and can never achieve anything. Even if she achieves anything, they will only see it as a pass given to her, claiming that she only achieved it because she is a woman. Throughout history, feminism has been considered one of the biggest movements made by humankind. Women are traditionally seen as housewives, with the purpose of continuing the legacy of their spouse and serving them all their lives. They are expected to give full submission of themselves to their man, losing self-control and freedom. Feminist critics look at literature that focuses on male-dominated perspectives. They examine the gender stereotypes shown in the story and sometimes discover works made by women resisting sexism. Now, we will try to analyze the novel Pride and Prejudice through the lens of feminism. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The novel highlights the need for a woman to be wed to a man in order for her to live a successful life. This context can be seen in light of feminism as somewhat reflecting the traditional viewpoints of people when it comes to women. People see the worth of a woman based on her status in life, whether she is single or married. If she is married, then all the good things in life will come to her. However, if a woman is single, she is considered unlucky and unlovable. People judge her capabilities, and if it happens that her family is financially unstable, then she is doomed to carry hardships for the rest of her life. The novel also highlights male-dominated fields and continues to disregard the capabilities of women, which is what feminists are fighting for.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">That being said, women are believed to exist with the purpose of only being a man's wife and proving themselves to that sole man. Even if they have dreams they want to achieve, they are caged by society to enter married life. The character of Mrs. Bennet represents the traditional thinking of people. She is anxious to wed her daughters and believes that they need a rich man to get through their lives. Even if her intentions were all for the good of her daughters, it is still not aligned with the concept of feminism, where women needs to have the same rights that men are getting. <br><i>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. "When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Moreover, the story is heavily influenced by the gender of Jane Austen, the author of the book. Jane Austen uses the character of Elizabeth Bennet to instigate an empowerment among women. The main character is often seen breaking the norms and was built to be strong, independent, and clever amidst the standards set by society. Austen wanted to bring change during her time. She wanted to let her work to be a voice that a woman should not be defined by men, that they can make their own choices, and that they can create a future for themselves. It is important for them to take matters into their own hands, because if they won’t, then they will be forever caged into the marriage set by the society upon them. <br><i>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any." <br>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"<br>"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Apart from that, what seemed like a love story in Pride and Prejudice hides a layer of feminism beneath. In the story, men and women are different from one another. It is like men are on top of the mountains and women are continuously down the edge. Men are often seen as powerful and have the privilege to choose a woman that they want to marry. Mr. Darcy can go to work as he pleases, travel around the world, and command women as he wishes. The advantages enjoyed by men are what women are deprived of. Elizabeth Bennet, on the other hand, is unable to enjoy the same privileges experienced by men. Even if she is intelligent and educated, the only thing that she can do to make herself worthy is by marrying a man. Even in marriage, she does not have the freedom to choose the man she wants to marry, she just need to wait until a man comes to her. These standards become a source of conflict in their growing love for each other, as Mr. Darcy begins to think of himself too highly, feeling entitled to insult Elizabeth's life while also asking her to marry him. Mr. Darcy is like all the other men during the time. They are very confident that the woman they would ask to marry will only say yes because they believe that asking for a woman's hand is already an honor to her. <br><i>"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."<br>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Furthermore, the novel challenges traditional views of women in many ways. Elizabeth Bennet is the epitome of feminism in the novel. She is a headstrong and educated girl who does think of her actions thoroughly before acting upon on it. She defies traditional views of women, for she is willing to walk three hours in the mud just to visit her sister. Even Caroline Bingley is amazed by what she can do. Another scenario that showcases Elizabeth's tenacity is how she rejected Mr. Darcy's proposal. This was big at that time because women are supposed to wait for a man to ask them a marriage, and it is a big thing if they are chosen. Elizabeth defied the traditional view that women must be caged in a marriage to someone they neither want nor love. She does not care what others think of her; rather, she is willing to stand up for herself, which demonstrates feminism.<br><i>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.<br>"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."<br>"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">This can also be seen in how Elizabeth is a feminine heroine, staying true to her beliefs and not letting the traditional viewpoints of people pull her down.<br><i>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Pride and Prejudice mainly talks about the patriarchal society ruled by men. This means that, during the time, men were the most powerful and highly regarded by society. The first part can be seen as the restrictions placed on women, wherein the ownership of real estate and its inheritance was solely limited to male heirs. Elizabeth's character is portrayed during the Regency Era, where women were required to follow the specific behaviors and standards imposed by society. One example that highlights this is the fate of Charlotte Lucas, who let herself be caged on the norms of society and failed to resist them.<br><i>"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it." <br>"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."</i></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Overall, if we're going to look at the novel from a Feminist Critic point of view, the story clearly shows conflict between traditional viewpoints of the society and the urge to resist them as personified by Elizabeth Bennet. The story revolves around men that are often regarded as superior to women. A woman is required to submit to a man, leaving her no choice but to follow what is asked of her and never to do what she wants to do. This is how Elizabeth became an epitome of feminism for many because she does not conform to the standard role of women and paved the way to breaking restrictive societal norms. She has proven that even a middle-class girl can stand up for herself and go against the people that undermines the capabilities of women.</p>
