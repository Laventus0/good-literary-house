            <p>“Queste” by Angie Sage: An Archetypal Criticism</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Angie Sage’s “Queste” is a 2008 fantasy novel that follows the main character’s growth from being a Wizard Apprentice to an ExtraOrdinary Wizard. He is mentored by the current ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand. To continue his journey, it is part of the tradition of Wizard Apprentices to draw a stone from a huge urn. If the stone with a large “Q” was drawn, it means the Apprentice must go on the “Queste” which no apprentice, except for one, has returned from. However, the story’s main conflict is rescuing Septimus’ brother, Nicko. Who is stuck in a place where all times meet, also called “House of Foryx”. He is accompanied by his adopted sister and Princess of the kingdom, Princess Jenna, and his best friend, Beetle. He hid the fact that he did draw the Questing Stone from them to prevent them worrying so they could focus on the mission at hand, rescuing Nicko.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">While the hero archetype is usually the main character, it cannot be seen in this particular novel. According to Wurdeman (2022), many protagonists fall under the hero archetype but not all do. Septimus Heap is more of a mother archetype, even if he is male, since he was the one nurturing his companions’ well-being. He was the one reminding them not to get into dangerous situations and he ensures that the needs of those around him are satisfied. The fact that he did not tell his companions that he drew the Questing Stone and that he might not return, showed his care for their mental state and he did not make them worry about his fate.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Princess Jenna fit the hero archetype the most since she was the one hungry for adventure. She exemplified courage as she was the one who urged Septimus and Beetle that they should be the ones to rescue Nicko because no one else would. She was relentless in saving her favorite brother even though she did not have any Magykal Powers like the wizards in the story. Princess Jenna did not let anyone stop her from doing what is good even if it means disobeying the orders of Marcia Overstrand.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Beetle is the helper in the story. He was able to find solutions for the little problems that they faced in their quest. He had connections with a lot of characters like Ephaniah Grebe that could assist the trio when faced with troubles.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Merrin Meredith and the ghost ofTertius Fume are the villains of Queste. Their main purpose in the story is to “Darken” the destiny of Septimus Heap. Merrin Meredith was the first one to attempt doing it but was unsuccessful. So, he asked Tertius Fume for help.
                                        <br><i>“So you’ve tried to Darken AnOther’s Destiny, have you?” Tertius asked. “And why would a young snake like you want to embark upon such a Darke journey, hmm? When I was your age I’d have chanced my luck with a sharp blade first. Much more satisfying.” The ghost chuckled as though reliving fond memories.
                                        <br>Merrin sounded taken aback. “Oh. Well, I don’t really like knives,” he mumbled.
                                        <br>“Ah, you prefer other to do your work for you, do you? Employ a little subterfuge, a little deceit, hey? I’ve seen your kind before. You prefer to be the puppet master pulling the strings. But, be warned, when you dabble with the Darke you may find that you become the puppet.”</i>
                                        <br>This interaction caused Septimus to embark on a Queste he was totally unprepared for. After Merrin and Tertius’ deal, the ghost decided to make Septimus draw a stone from the huge urn and rig it to force the Questing Stone into Septimus’ hand. It was these two that made the life of the protagonist and those around him difficult, exemplifying true villains.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Nicko Heap, Septimus’ and Princess Jenna’s older brother that is stuck in the House of Foryx, is the character that the trio was trying to rescue all throughout the story. This makes him the damsel-in-distress archetype. It was hopeless for Nicko to get out of such place without another from his own time coming to rescue him.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Madam Marcia Overstrand ExtraOrdinary Wizard was the father in the story. She is the most powerful wizard in Wizard Way and her main role is to be a mentor to Septimus Heap. She has saved Septimus multiple times in the story including the final part where she rid a dragon to rescue Septimus and his companions when they were the ones who got stuck in the place that Nicko was also trapped in.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Coincidentally, Queste has a quest situational archetype. The three characters’ goal in the story is to search for the place where all times meet and Nicko Heap. The book was centered around this adventure and it ended once they were successful in completing the quest.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">An archetypal image shown in Queste is the color green for luck. All throughout the story’s history, the Wizard Apprentice has always worn the green robe until they switch to a pruple robe once they achieve the ExtraOrdinary Wizard title. He was shown as lucky since unlike apprentices before him, he had companions when he embarked on his Queste. This made him the second Wizard Apprentice ever to come out alive from the Queste where 19 out of the 21 Wizard Apprentices have died.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Another image is the desert. In this case, it was a cold desert like Antarctica for it was a vast place filled with just snow, some trees, and a river. The House of Foryx is in the dead center of the cold desert where the trio lost the most hope in the story. Even though they had a map of the place, it tore into pieces and once restored, it was missing the piece where the House of Foryx was drawn in. They lost hope since they did not know what it looked like, therefore not knowing what to look for or expect. They were also just thrown into a random spot in the cold desert by a portal so they did not even know which part of the map they were in. There were no landmarks and no distinctive features which almost caused them to give up on their quest.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The number three (3) represents unity when taken in an archetypal sense. There were three characters to embark on the Queste: Septimus, Princess Jenna, and Beetle. Without uniting with each other, it would have been impossible for them to succeed in the Queste and in rescuing Nicko from the place where all times meet.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Overall. Angie Sage’s “Queste” is a high-intensity fantasy novel that shows character archetypes in a unique way. Including the protagonist not exemplifying the hero archetype, the mother being a boy, the father being a woman, and the damsel-in-distress being represented by an older brother. Its characters and symbolisms are told in the simplest way possible making it an enjoyable read for fantasy-loving readers from all ages.</p>
