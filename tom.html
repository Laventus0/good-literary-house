            <p>Biographical Criticism of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The author of the novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is Mark Twain. Twain based the character Tom Sawyer through himself and on the memories of boyhood experiences and friendships of his childhood, which led to writing the novel. We will eventually now attempt to evaluate the book from a biographical viewpoint.   It is the story of a young boy's transition into a young man. This story has a double appeal. First, it appeals to the young adolescent as the exciting adventures of a typical boy during the mid-nineteenth century. Second, the novel appeals to the adult reader who looks back on their childhood with fond reminiscences. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In the first edition, Twain wrote, "Although my book intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls el part of my plan has been to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and what they felt and thought." The novel is therefore a blend of the past and the present, of the vivid childhood memories presented in a way that evokes memories in the adult mind. Even though Tom Sawyer takes place in a little western frontier town on the banks of the legendary Mississippi River sometime in the 1840s, Tom and his group of pals go on various adventures. The novel's success primarily stems from Twain's ability to encapsulate or retell commonplace childhood worries, dreams, and experiences.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The story is a combination of Twain's imagination and his real-life experiences. Huckleberry Finn's character is based on his friend Tom Blankenship, whose father is often drunk. Huck is a juvenile outcast who is shunned by respectable society and adored by the local boys, who envy his freedom. Aunt Polly, Tom's aunt and guardian is a simple kind-hearted woman even if she is strict that reflects Twain's mother. On the other hand, Sid, Tom's half-brother, is mean-spirited but presents a superficial show of model behavior, this character is most likely influenced by the siblings of Twain.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Like Tom, Twain experienced a childhood filled with mischief and adventures. The first chapter entitled "Mischievous Tom" begins with Aunt Polly looking for Tom.<br>"TOM!" No answer.<br>"TOM!" No answer.<br>"What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!" No answer.<br>Aunt Polly cannot find Tom anywhere even if she looks among the tomato vines in the garden. Then she lifted her voice and shouted- "Y-o-u-u TOM!"</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">She heard a silent noise and found Tom hiding in the closet eating jam and Tom denied that he had been eating jam. Aunt Polly moved ahead to beat him, but Tom played an old trick on her to look behind and Tom quickly ran out of the house. Tom has a wonderful time missing school for playing with friends and swimming in the river. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Apart from that it shows little Twain's escapades which are playing pranks, getting into trouble, and seeking adventures instead of attending classes. Twain’s use of humor and satire is evident throughout the story. As Tom skipped class, Aunt Polly wanted to punish him by painting the fence. Tom getting out of chores by pretending to be sick or tricking other boys into painting the fence for him, reflects Twain’s mischievous nature. When he convinces his friends to do his work for him it illustrates his cleverness showing that this action cannot be learned from school.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In chapter 8, Tom and Huck go to the graveyard and get to know about the murder of Dr. Robinson. The day after Tom and Huck see Dr. Robinson’s murder, some people find Dr. Robinson’s dead body in the cemetery. They also find Potter’s knife there. A crowd gathers around the body. Then, to Tom’s and Huck’s surprise and especially to Potter’s shock. Injun Joe tells everyone that Potter was the one who committed the murder. Because of this, the sheriff arrests Potter for the crime. It was a big shock for everyone, especially Tom and Huck because they knew the real truth but couldn’t say anything.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The novel shows that as Tom grows up, he starts to understand the difference between right and wrong. He also learns about the tough consequences of doing things like telling lies or betraying others. This change in Tom’s character is similar to Mark Twain’s own experience growing up. Twain learned how to deal with the tricky parts of being an adult, like understanding people’s feelings and knowing what’s right and what’s wrong in society.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">There is an adventure where Tom and his friends Huck and Joe come to think that they are the three pirates then they sail a raft. They become pirates and enjoy their new life. Fantastic treasure hunts and swimming with friends are truly nostalgic feelings for them. But at last, they think to go back to the town. Mark Twain often found himself wandering the hills and riverbanks of his hometown, Hannibal, looking for adventures. His father was strict and sometimes absent, leaving Twain to explore on his own. Chapter 11 entitled “The Three Pirates” resembles how Twain enable to make a novel based on his own life that appeal to readers of all ages.  Twain reflects on his childhood and uses it to show how society placed limits on young boys.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In the last chapter of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," Mark Twain wraps up the story by showing Tom and Huck on the edge of a new phase in their lives. They are about to take on new responsibilities and leave behind their carefree days as kids. Twain’s story about Tom and Huck last moments on a hill feels nostalgic, like when he remembered walking around his hometown, Hannibal, Missouri. Overall, this story mixes Twain’s own experiences with big life lessons, showing that growing up comes with both challenges and rewards.</p>
