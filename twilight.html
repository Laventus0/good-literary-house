            <p>Biographical Criticism of Stephenie Meyer’s “Twilight”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Twilight is a 2005 young adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer. It is the first book in the Twilight series, which tells the story of seventeen-year-old Isabella "Bella" Swan, who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington, endangered after falling in love with Edward Cullen, a 103-year-old vampire frozen in his 17-year-old body. The other novels in the series include New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In my opinion, the story twilight is not as scary as a romantic and emotional book. The reason I chose twilight is it shows a lot of things that are you won't see happening in real life. It's not like the other literary piecethat is based on the true story, but it is very similar to our imagination. After reading Twilight it feels like i am hooked to try and read more books, when i started reading some books i saw this one, it was very interesting; even though, I didn’t understand much. Days after our literature teacher gave us a task to criticize a book, I decided to reread this book; it was a totally different book for me. I figured out that the book is really quite different from the movie. Stephenie Meyer's life can be mirrored in Twilight. As a mother of three, she not only carves the essence of motherhood and family interaction in developing character relationships but also the bond with Bella and her father, Charlie Swan.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Meyer has said ideals of love purity, importance in self-control, and conscience in the Weinmann twilights-most imminent themes of the story. His representation as one of human conflicts of craving and self-control, primarily in Edward's being dependent-has told Meyer about the reaction of self-discipline and moral integrity in being after that kind of drive.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Major issues tackled by Twilight are about love: what it is, which choices change it, and what one has to decide between the fulfillment of his or her own desires and the demands of morals. Such issues show what might have been the author's personal problems especially regarding romantic relationships, belongingness, and what she could give or receive.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">There are some fictional elements and some autobiographical elements in twilight, such as inspiration from a dream-segment, a dream to be precise, which could fall into an extraordinary type of event that she turned into a romance story with danger.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The characters of Twilight may not be real, but Meyer declares that she was inspired by her life experiences and the relationships she had. Bella Swan is actually a kind of hybrid of different sides of Meyer as far as her insecurities and dreams go. On the other hand, Edward Cullen could stand for some of those qualities that Meyer admires or even holds dear in relationships exhibited by his protective nature and depth.</p>
