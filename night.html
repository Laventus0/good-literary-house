            <p>Formalist Criticism of Colin McNaughton’s “Nighty Night!” </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The story "Nighty Night!" by Colin Mcnaughton is a bedtime story for kids and it's all about a family of Dinosaurs where the young dino refuses to sleep no matter how hard his dino parents try. It tells the tale of the Littlesaurus, a little dinosaur who does not want to go to bed and has an awful lot of reasons and excuses why he can't possibly go to bed and this is a relatable story for everyone.  This book is full of cartoon images of dinosaurs which are really interesting and entertaining to read, particularly for children who don't want to sleep at night. If you'll read this book, expect that there should be a tone in how you read the sentences or phrases here to make it more entertaining for kids  because the words here are very common that you probably must have heard whenever your parents put you to sleep when you are still a kid.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">On the first page alone, you can see that the little dino's answer is "NO" already, because his Daddysaurus is already putting him to sleep. No matter how many times he is told off, the little dino is really naughty, so his Daddysaurus asks Mommysaurus for help, but the little dino still doesn't budge and keeps making up all sorts of reasons why he doesn't want to go to bed and sleep. Considering his parents were so tired of scolding him, they ended up falling asleep because of mischievousness and stubbornness of their child, little saurus. And Little saurus snuggled in between his parents and went straight to sleep.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">"Nighty night!" is better for kids especially those children who are just starting to learn how to read because the book only contains simple words. And for parents and also who can relate to the situation and also have a hard time getting their children to sleep.</p>
